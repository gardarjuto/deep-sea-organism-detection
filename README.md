# Deep-sea organism detection
This project is done as part of my final year doing the Computer Science Tripos (CST) at the University of Cambridge.

The aim is to produce a pipeline to detect _mostly sessile_ _benthic_ organisms in deep-sea imagery and video. The project compares classical approaches for feature extraction like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to more recent methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It is built in the PyTorch framework and uses the [FathomNet](http://fathomnet.org/fathomnet/) dataset for training and evaluation.
